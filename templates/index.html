              <!-- Instructions for file structure -->
              This tool accepts from 1-20 files containing survey data. <br>
              The files must be structured such that the survey questions are listed in the first row, and all <br>
              responses for each question are listed in the column beneath the question. For instance, if you are <br>
              uploading an excel file, the first survey question will be in cell A1, and the responses to that question <br>
              are listed in cells A2, A3, A4, and so on. The second question is in cell B1, and its responses are in <br>
              cells B2, B3, B4, etc. <br>
              <!-- Example file structure -->

              If you are selecting multiple files, you must be sure that both the content and order of your questions are identical across all files.<br>
              <br>
              Please remember to provide rich context surrounding your survey.<br>
              <br>
              If you are submitting a file containing metrics, please format it so that each question's metrics are listed 
              sequentially in the first row of the file. For instance, the metrics for the first question 
              are in cell A1, metrics for the second question are in cell A2, and so on.
